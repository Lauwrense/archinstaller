# Arch Post Installation Setup Script
These are scripts I made to speed the post installation process of Arch. Arch post install tends to be the parts where it's a hassle due to the amount of packages I use. These scripts install and setup some parts of the post installation process which I usually do.
# Steps
The order of script execution is odered by it's number. It would be your choice if you wish to install it at a different order but you need to be aware of what each of these scripts does before attempting to run them in different orders. 

The script all-at-once.sh combines all of these processes in one go and is preconfigured with a predefined user. There are also additional stuff I may have with this script as this script is more likely to be a general purpose script. 

NOTE: There is no post configuration after these installation scripts are you must do these post configs on your own.
